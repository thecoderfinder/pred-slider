# preds




So Preds are a really cool thing but if you don't know how to figure it out this is a perfect DLL file for guerilla tag so go ahead drag the mod into gorilla tag and make sure if you're in gorilla tag restart gorilla tag after you do that on your desktop monitor click gorilla tag if you're already on it click that looking rainbow button now you should see a slider move that to whatever you want you got red slider now have fun
